## New Flutter App: ##
This codelab creates an application that displays a JSON document in Flutter. The application simulates JSON coming from an external source. The JSON contains document data such as the modification date, title, headers, and paragraphs. You write code to neatly pack data into records so that it can be transferred and unpacked wherever your Flutter widgets need it.

You then use patterns to build the appropriate widget when the value matches that pattern. You also see how to use patterns to destructure data into local variables.

My third project in Flutter is based off https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab-web <br>
This is in preparation for SC2006 Software Engineering in Y2S2.
